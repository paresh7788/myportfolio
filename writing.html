        <h2>Not all about</h2>
        Its all about waiting,
                             Not finding way to give up.
        Its about cheering up,
                              Not teasing you down.
        Its all about acceptance,
                               Not the multiple choice option.
        Its all about feel from heart
                                Not touch from body.
        Its all about the depth ness ,
                                Not the distance you have.
        Its all about unconditional things,
                                Not an equation with condition
        Its not all about choosing the perfect one,
           Its all about having the loving one.
        Coz,
        Love will not ask you to shrink yourself down,love will beg you 
        to grow :)

        <h2>And that dream</h2>
        At the roof top, under the sky at night, we were lying. She 
        was keeping her head on my left arm. Stars were glittering like 
        such , they were looking us from the 5th floor. Not a hello , not a 
        hey, not even a single word . Everyone won’t understand those 
        unspoken words. Slow music was going on the background. One 
        in mine and one in her ear, the earphone was playing its role so 
        perfectly.
        Suddenly those two pair of eyes got connected. And…BOOM.
        Beat got faster ,those cute eyes of her made me kiss on those. The 
        compressed sorrow of her heart tried to come out through those 
        eyes. That waterly eyes of her made her cute a thousand times as 
        before. Eight years of emotion came out, tears were at it’s peak.
        Her face which was looked by the stars before was now on my 
        chest.
        With her opened hair on my face , my beauty cutely warned me 
        with a puppy face. “Listen, if you do anything like that 
        further…. I will break your leg” , she told me this with holding 
        my shirt collar.
        Her love was still same for me which was completely visible in her 
        eyes 
        Adjusting her hair , set it behind her ear, wiping her tears and 
        holding her face in my hand I kissed her forehead.
        What a smile came on her rosy lips…..!!! mine was about to touch 
        her lips , feel her breadth…??
        Suddenly I came out from my DREAM .
        I wish I could tell herI love you at least. Bloody alarm 
        clock………...

        <h2>Serial Healer</h2>
        
        Like seriously , the end gonna be happen in this way !!?
        ohhh… okay , you don’t have enough patience to tolerate all this 
        stuffs that is going in your life ! You tried off explaining people , 
        you tried off failures , be cheated , loneliness . Life is not going in 
        the way you thought , everything is messed up. So you choose 
        suicide as a solution !! wow nice ?!
        But dear is that a proper solution ? I don’t think so .
        Have you ever imagine when it will late there will be no one for 
        whom, your mother will be waiting for to come back to home. 
        Your father will be so helpless , Can you ever imagine the pain in 
        his eyes that his child is no more. Think about that gorgeous smile 
        on your mother’s face , will that remains same?? There will be no 
        one for whom your sibling will be waiting for to come back from 
        work place and enjoy the occasion together. They will lost one of 
        their best friend. What is their fault ?? The people who really 
        cared about you , Are you really going to take all those smiling 
        faces , are you such a selfish ?? 
        You have faced so many toughest situations for your closed ones. 
        Now when its about you , you want to quit ?? are you such a 
        coward ??
        Can’t you remember how a happy creature you used to be. You 
        were doing whatever you want to ,despite of thinking what people
        will think. Don’t you remember that little version of yourself who 
        found joy in little things. No matter what it was….. breaking 
        those toys to find some LED lights and felt like a scientist , 
        wearing dad’s chappal in those tiny feet to felt like head of the 
        family , waiting outside the kitchen for your mom to complete the 
        dishes , irritating your sibling without any reason , being the 
        happiest when there was an occasion , being sleepless when your 
        favorite cousins were arrived. How can’t you remember the tiny 
        but better version of yourself ??
        I understand you have depression , anxiety , loneliness , love 
        failure , career tension , family pressure , job pressure , society 
        pressure but listen if your life is going smooth then it is going 
        wrong. The harder is the pressure the better will be the glow. Just 
        believe in self.
        You worked hard ?? now work harder. You cried alone ?? its time 
        to be happy alone. Don’t try to find love in each and everyone. The 
        right one is already reserved for you , just wait for the right time. 
        You don’t have to explain yourself to everyone. One day you will 
        find someone who will understand you without your explanation.
        Just upgrade yourself if suicide was the solution , today no one 
        would have been successful. Don’t let these small things break you 
        , coz you are a Serial Healer. Its time for back to track , go 
        champ RUN……

        <h2>Yes You Are…..</h2>
        why he can’t….?? why he can’t cry?? 
        What the hell is this that a boy can’t cry. 
        He cried when he did not get his favorite toy.
        He cried when he imagined his mom is leaving him.
        He cried when dad warned him to put him in the hostel.
        He cried when got some wound in the knee.
        He cried when tuition teacher scolded him for not doing 
        homework.
        Then why not today…..
         The depression ,family pressure, job tension , break up , 
        study pressure , society pressure , mental illness aren’t enough 
        to wet his eyes.
        I think yes it is ,at least tough reasons than those above 
        childhood dramas.
        Kick these so called tags as macho, stud , sigma to hide your 
        sorrow. You can cry and you are allowed to. You are also 
        human being after all. Why can’t you……?
        Yes you are completely allowed to cry. Yes you are……

        <h2>Warrior Soul</h2>
        This is nothing , but a inner voice in common
        Each of us have experienced this sound inside going on.

        “Am I the same ME,
                      Why am not feeling happy as I used to be”.
        “Bothering by little things what I see,
                      I think this Overthinking is killing me”.
        Listen ,
        You have to deal,
        You have to heal,
        This is your life ,not instagram reel.
        I know you shout,
        I know you fought,
        But deep down you have to choose your own route.
        Just have that faith in your role,
        Believe in your goal,
        My buddy you have a warrior soul.

        <h2>The Perfect Way</h2>
        Look her in such a way , 
             That she adjusts her hair not her top.
        Treat her in such a way ,
               That she feels like a queen not a victim.
        Smile at her in such a way,
                That she finds you cute not creepy.
         Touch her in such a way ,
               That she finds its romantic not ill itentional.
        Make her feel in such a way ,
                That she feels like a girl not an object.
         Be a male in such a way ,
                 That she feels you are a real man not a RAPIEST.
